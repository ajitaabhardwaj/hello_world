Hey this is Nishan D' Almeida, prefer to be called "Nick" (XD), From a small Town in Udupi which you'll definetly not know.
Branch : Information technology (IT).
Just another guy trying out something new everyday. (*want to)

Fun Fact : I want to learn something new everyday yet somehow I end up doing "Nothing"!!
           Well, this time it serious!

Currently in the middle of writing Operating Systems Lab Manual (lol). Deeply thinking how senseless it is.
Not well, hence considering bunking the Classes tomorrow.

(Actually hoping nobody reads this!)
